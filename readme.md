RADseq analysis of brown bear samples collected from Sarıkamış

This tutorial includes the analysis of RAD-sequencing (A next-generation sequencing method) of brown bears. The samples from brown bears were collected from Sarıkamış, Kars region since 2012 by Kuzey Doğa Derneği (Association). The captured bears were GPS-collared to determine their foraging behavior. The brown bear populations found in these regions with high anthropogenic impact show two basic life history strategies in terms of feeding behavior. The first strategy is ‘sedentary’, in which Eastern Anatolian brown bears use urban garbage dumps as their primary feeding area and rarely forage in natural habitats. The second type of strategy is ‘migratory’, in which Eastern Anatolian brown bears do not normally go to the dump but actively migrate to find food in natural habitats. 
In here, you can see the population genetics analysis for the Eastern Anatolia brown bear population as well as behavioral differences within the population.
